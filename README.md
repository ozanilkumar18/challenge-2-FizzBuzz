# JS Challenge 2 - FizzBuzz

Please make a js file called fizzBuzz.js and export a function that takes in a start number and finish number and produces a CSV string of results.

Note: This is just a JS challenge, no need for any react

- For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, console log "FizzBuzz".
- For every number that is divisible by only 3 and not 5, console log "Fizz".
- For every number that is divisible by only 5 and not 3, console .log "Buzz".

For example `fizzBuzz(12, 20)` should return a string: 
`"Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz"`
